Explicit data management
=============

Steps
----

1. Add data directives to implement the minimum number of data movements.
2. Open the Makefile and add instructions to targer Leonardo's accelerators
3. Modify the jobscript is order to compile and run the code.

Questions
--------

- Compare the time to solution GPU code vs serial code. Do you observe a speed up now?
- Did the ratio among time spent in computation and data movements changed? why? (check with the profiler)
